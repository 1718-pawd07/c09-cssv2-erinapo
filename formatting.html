			<p>Soccer, also known as f√∫tbol, is one of the most popular sports worldwide, but not in the United States. It is probably the most popular sport over in Europe, and practically everywhere else in the world, except for the U.S., where football is the main sport for entertainment.</p>
			
			<p>I love playing soccer with my friends as well as my team. I first started playing in second grade or so for the YMCA. </p>
			
			<p>I also enjoy going to professional games and watching pro teams play against each other. I've been to one women's national team game as well as one men's national team game. I go with my family to these games and we normally spend the day tailgating before. Union games get very rowdy however they are fun to watch.</p>
			<p>Here are some teams:</p>
